<h3>
SOLUTIONS AND OFFERINGS
</h3>

<p>
<b>MOTOR SURGERY</b>
Auto Service and Repairs, a subsidiary of SEWGAMO Holding a Black-owned Company established in 2016, operates in the
Motor Repair and Service Industry. Currently the industry is highly concentrated and as such there is less competition
and consumers, who happens to be owners and operators of motor vehicles, do not have enough choices when it comes to
after sales support and service. MOTOR SURGERY Auto Service and Repair is the first ambitious, profit-oriented black
owned Auto Repairs and Service in Africa situated in South. The business is Retail Motor Industry Organisation (RMI)
registered and, therefore the Quality, Price, and Delivery Standards are controlled. All work carries a six (6) months
warranty, while all parts warranty is as per the supplier.
</p>

        <p>
        The Enterprise has taken the first step to contribute in opening up choices to allow consumers the right to select
        where their vehicles are serviced, maintained and repaired, at the right quality, on time, and at competitive prices
        and in the workshops of their preference. It is the view of The Motor Industry Workshop Association (Miwa) that in the
        current practices consumers are locked into restrictive warranties that are of long duration and they cannot choose
        where they service their vehicles during this time. Consumers are similarly compelled to pay a much higher rate for
        repairs and parts for their vehicles under warranty when compared to the rates charged by independent workshops, which
        is where MOTOR SURGERY Auto Service and Repairs has positioned itself.

  - SUB-CONTRACTING SERVICES AND JOINT VENTURES

<p>
  We form joint venture in response to preferential procurement policies of the country which should share in at least

  i) Control<br>
  ii) Management<br>
  iii) Operations<br>
  iv) Risk<br>
  v) Profit, or loss

</p>

<p>
  We understand that joint ventures may be formed prior to the award of a contract, with the objective of securing it,
  which is most common, or as a condition for the award of a contract, this often being the case where joint ventures
  are formed to secure a preference in the evaluation of tenders. The main-contractor, normally, has no reason to be
  overly concerned with the contents of the agreement between the members of a joint venture. However, when the employer
  stipulates the formation of a joint venture as a condition for the award of a contract, in order to promote the skills
  and expertise of an emerging firm, the situation is rather different. In this case, the employer has both a moral
  obligation and a vested interest in ensuring that both the emerging firm and its established joint venture partner are
  treated reasonably and equitably in terms of a sound, written agreement.

<h4>
  - SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENTS, GOODS AND SERVICES
</h4>

<p>
  The company causes the manufacture of and installation of electronic equipment for compliance purposes. These include
  the installation of heating as well as cooling and ventilation. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) has
  become a major part of industrial premises. Industrial premises have special requirements which are more complex than
  commercial buildings and require customised solutions.
</p>


<p>
  The company understands that some of the specifics to manufacturing area may be: <br>
  • High heat load due to the machinery in use.<br>
  • Air quality problems due to the materials being used in the process (paint bays, grinding, sanding, welding,
  cutting, powders, dry material and others).<br>
  • Accurate control of temperature and humidity in specific manufacturing areas (clean room requirements).<br>
  • Explosion-proof environments.

</p>

<p>
  All of these requirements can exist in a single facility, and the energy account must take them all into account if
  the overall design is to achieve the desired result. Manufacturing and industrial facilities tackle a varying load of
  heavy-duty projects during their day-to-day operations so that HVAC system designers face a number of challenges to
  achieve sustainable, energy-efficient solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Industrial environments have a wide range of HVAC requirements. Where commercial and retail facilities are focused on
  comfort cooling, an industrial facility may need explosion-proof ventilation in one area and a clean-room environment
  in another. Process air streams may require large volumes of outside air and use specialised systems to clean the air.
  All of this may require ancillary air handling and conditioning systems over and above the facility plant, but still
  require a supply of quality air intake to function properly.

<h4>
- AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENT MANUFACTURING
</h4>

<p>
MSVM positioned itself to be a major player as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The OEM is the original
producer of a vehicle's components, so OEM car parts are identical to the parts used in producing a vehicle. OEM
products are usually only available for purchase directly through dealerships.
</p>

<p>
OEM parts are usually guaranteed by the automaker to be compatible with the vehicle; installation of the parts may
also be guaranteed in some cases. MSVM chose the OEM parts, as a unique selling point to differentiate itself from
other manufacturers because OEM parts usually only offer one or two options for consumers, making the experience of
replacing parts rather less complicated.
</p>

<p>
MSVM’s main objective of purchasing a company and/or a number of companies in the automotive component manufacturing
industry and grouping them to form a meaningful player is through adding value by not only i) expanding the market
size, but ii) by also enhancing company operations to move it into the next tier. <br> <br>
i) <b>
  Market expansion:
</b> The Company brings in shared value creation to expand the market. By assisting the acquired
manufacturers to access the transformation incentives such as BBB-EE codes of good practice equity equivalents; Black
Industrialists incentives and grow their participation in the support for Localisation the acquired manufacturers will
benefit from the demand that comes from these incentives while contributing to both economic and employment growth.

<br> <br>

ii) Operational and Efficiency Enhancement: MSVM’s value add is also to accentuate the understanding in the group that
to meet the growing complexity of OEM requirements and tighter production schedules, as part of the automotive tier
suppliers the company must have efficient processes in place to ensure it can produce products faster. The company
need to prioritise the availability of engineering and product development capabilities that can keep up with
accelerating product evolution and shorter product lifecycles. In addition, the company also need to accurately
forecast demand for your products, so you have the right quantity in the right place at the right time, without
holding excess inventory and tying up operational costs.

<br> <br>
Even with all that in place, MSVM also still need efficient manufacturing processes to get the group’s products to
market quickly and increase sales, while controlling the costs of goods sold (COGS) and lowering the sales, general,
and administration (SG&A) overhead. To compete effectively, the group will streamline workflows, and use smart
shipping and logistics planning. The group will also acquire a solution that’s designed to meet the specific needs of
automotive tier suppliers like you.

<br> <br>
iii)	MSVM will also be bringing expansion capital to grow the business <br> <br>
iv)	MSVM will create synergies that will enable competitiveness.

          In MSVM quest to buy existing companies, it takes cognisance of the tier the company that it is purchasing ownership
          of is in as well as the kind of value stream they are engaging, as MSVM’s main objective of purchasing such a company
          is to add value by not only i) expanding the market size, but ii) by also enhancing company operations to move it into
          the next tier. Tier 1, Tier 2, & Tier 3 suppliers refer primarily to suppliers of the automotive industry.
